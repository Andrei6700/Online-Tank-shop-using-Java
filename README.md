# Military Tank Shop
This project represents a store of military tanks from several countries, such as the USA and Germany. 

I chose to make it about tanks because I have always been passionate about everything military vehicles from planes to submarines, tanks, etc and plus I am a big fan of [WarThunder](https://warthunder.com/en/)

I made this site to be able to present it to my college class "Java" where I chose to make it using React and Java.

# Demo
In this link : https://military-tank-shop-oxg6qq21u-andrei6700.vercel.app/ 
, we have offered the possibility to try this tank shop, with small limitations too:
- data added by the user will not be added to the database;

Whereby a small error will appear after you have clicked on the ``Sent`` but.ton

# Install
Clone the project, enter the project's folder, do: ``npm install`` then ``npm start`` and it's up.

# Startup

After modifying config.js, you need to open 2 terminals:
 To start the front-end, in the first terminal enter command: ``npm start``.
 After adding the above command, you need to go to the ``server`` folder and enter ``npm run server``.
